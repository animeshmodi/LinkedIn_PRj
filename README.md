## Features

- Convert LinkedIn PDF resume to HTML format

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Streamlit for the web interface
- PDFMinerPDFasHTMLLoader for PDF processing

## Why Groq API?

We chose to use the Groq API instead of OpenAI for this project because:
1. Groq offers a free tier, making it more accessible for development and testing.
2. It provides similar capabilities to OpenAI for our use case of answering questions about resume content.

## Deployment Choice

The application is deployed on Streamlit Share because:
1. Streamlit offers easy deployment for Python-based web applications.
2. It integrates well with machine learning models and data processing pipelines.
3. Streamlit Share provides a free hosting option for open-source projects.

## How to Use

1. Visit the [application URL](https://verfablo-linkedintohtml.streamlit.app/).
2. Enter your Groq API key when prompted.
3. Upload your LinkedIn PDF resume.
4. Click "Generate HTML Resume" to convert and display the resume.
5. Use the "Download HTML Resume" button to save the generated HTML file.
